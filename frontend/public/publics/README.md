Place the hero image named `fashion-trends-1-1.jpg` in this folder so the site will use it at the hero banner.

Recommended size: 1600x800 (or similar wide aspect ratio). File path in the app will be `/publics/fashion-trends-1-1.jpg`.

If you want me to add a temporary placeholder image here, tell me and I can create a simple SVG placeholder (note: SVG would be named .svg, not .jpg).
